This program is dynamic and the information displayed will depend on whether
it is a Chequing account or a Savings account.

To test this program run it as is. There is no file with account information
so the GUI will prompt you to enter in your name and the type of account you
wish to open. Default values will be assigned to the account.

You can deposit/ withdraw until satisfied. Then "Save and Exit". A file will 
be written in the 'Data' directory, which contains all your account informaiton.

If you relaunch the program, your data will be displayed.

Now, delete that text file and try making another account (if you created a
Savings account the first time through- try a Chequing account). You will 
see each account has slightly different information.

Go ahead and eneter in a negative number for a deposit. You will get an error
message.


Enjoy!
