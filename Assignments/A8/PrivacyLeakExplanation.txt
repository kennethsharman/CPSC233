Q: Why don't we have to worry about privacy leaks with respect to the accountHolder instance
variable in BankAccount?

Answer:
The variable accountHolder in the class BankAccount is not vulnerable to privacy leaks because
there is no setter methods in the Customer class which the variable accountHolder is calling 
to. Once a variable has been set by the constructor method, they cannot be changed later. The
locations of the instance varaibles within the Customer class cannot be changed from the other
classes and no other classes or methods can point to the same location of the instance variables.
